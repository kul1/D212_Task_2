        "1. General Cleaning Steps:\n"
        "- Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset were imputed using the mean for continuous variables.\n"
        "- Outlier Treatment: Outliers were capped within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) to reduce their impact on PCA results.\n"
        "- Data Type Verification: The data types for all selected variables were verified to confirm they were continuous measures.\n"

    document.add_paragraph(
        "2. Specific Preparation for PCA Analysis:\n"
        "- Standardization: Continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step ensures "
        "that all variables contribute equally to the PCA model, avoiding bias caused by scale differences.\n"

        "Figure 3 shows that after standardization, all variables exhibit comparable distributions centered around a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1. "

        "allowing dimensionality reduction without substantial information loss.\n"
        "2. Focus on Key Patterns: By retaining the components that explain the majority of the variance, we can focus on the most meaningful patterns in the data, "
        "simplifying the model and improving interpretability.\n"
